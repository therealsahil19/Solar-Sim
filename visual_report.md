## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### 1. 🟡 MED: Persistent Label Overlap on Mobile
**Location:** `mobile_audit.png` - Inner Planets  
**Perspective:** NORMAL VIEW (Content & Typography)

**Observation:** As noted in previous audits, Earth and Venus labels still overlap when their orbital paths bring them close together. The current collision detection or lack thereof makes the labels unreadable.

**Impact:** Reduced usability on mobile devices.

---

### 2. 🟢 LOW: Header Padding Asymmetry
**Location:** `desktop_audit.png` - Top Bar  
**Perspective:** ZOOM IN (Fine Details)

**Observation:** The "Solar-Sim" title text is still slightly off-center vertically within the top bar. There is ~2px more space above the text than below.

**Impact:** Minor visual jank; pixel-peeping priority.

---

### 3. 🟢 LOW: Tablet Dock Button Spacing
**Location:** `tablet_audit.png` - Bottom Dock  
**Perspective:** ZOOM IN (Fine Details)

**Observation:** The spacing between the 'Reset View' and 'Toggle Trails' icons appears to be 1px wider than the spacing between other icons in the dock.

**Impact:** Inconsistent rhythm in control group.

---

## ✅ Verified Improvements
- [x] **Planet Label Edge Clipping:** Resolved. No clipping observed at desktop edges.
- [x] **Title Text Shadow:** Resolved. Rendering appears clean at tablet resolution.
- [x] **Z-Index Wars:** No overlap issues between modals and header observed.

## 🎯 Severity Legend

| Icon | Severity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 🔴 | HIGH | Unusable UI, overlapping text making it unreadable, broken layout on standard view |
| 🟡 | MED | Visual jank, obvious misalignment, poor spacing, macro layout issues |
| 🟢 | LOW | Minor aesthetic nitpicks visible only upon "zooming in" (1-2px off) |
