# 👁️ Visual Inspection Report

| Screenshot | Viewport | Severity | Issue Type | Description |
|------------|----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| `desktop_initial.png` | Desktop | 🟡 MED | Rendering | Orbit trails appear as jagged, low-poly lines rather than smooth curves. |
| `mobile_initial.png` | Mobile | 🟡 MED | Layout | The bottom control dock consumes a significant portion of the vertical screen space (~25%), potentially obstructing the main view. |
| `mobile_initial.png` | Mobile | 🟢 LOW | Spacing | The 'Speed' label and slider in the mobile dock are tightly packed. |
| `desktop_initial.png` | Desktop | 🟢 LOW | Artifacts | Visible polygon edges on orbit trails (red/blue lines) distract from the visual fidelity. |
| `mobile_initial.png` | Mobile | 🟡 MED | Layout | [FIXED] The bottom control dock consumes a significant portion of the vertical screen space (~25%), potentially obstructing the main view. |

## Details

### 1. Jagged Orbit Trails (All Viewports)
**Severity: 🟡 MED**
The orbit trails (red, blue lines) are rendered with visible segments, creating a "low-poly" look. This is likely an optimization (fewer points in the line geometry) but significantly reduces visual quality. It is most noticeable on larger orbits like Jupiter/Saturn.

### 2. Mobile Dock Density
**Severity: 🟡 MED**
On `mobile_initial.png` (375x667), the bottom dock occupies a large amount of vertical space. The separation between the view controls (Camera, Reset, etc.) and the time controls (Play/Pause, Speed) creates a double-stacked footer that feels heavy.
**[FIXED]** - Reduced height to 48px, removed gaps, and tightened padding in `src/style.css`.

### 3. Previously Reported Issues Status
- **Disappearing Solar System:** FIXED. Objects are visible at distance.
- **Welcome Modal Layout:** FIXED. Title "Interactive Solar System" fits well.
- **Clipping Artifacts:** FIXED. No immediate clipping observed in standard views.
