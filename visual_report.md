## Details

### 1. Disappearing Solar System (Far Zoom)
**Severity: 🔴 HIGH**

### 2. Welcome Modal Layout (Mobile)
**Severity: 🟡 MED**
[FIXED] Added mobile-specific CSS overrides in `src/style.css` to reduce font sizes, use single-column grid, and handle text overflow.

### 3. Zoom/Clipping Artifacts
**Severity: 🟢 LOW**
[FIXED] Set `controls.minDistance` to 5 in `src/input.js` to prevent the camera from entering the Sun's geometry.
