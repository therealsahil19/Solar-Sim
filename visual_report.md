## Details

### 1. Footer Overlap (Mobile)
**Severity: 🔴 HIGH**
In `audit_mobile.png`, the footer text ("Solar-Sim · Built with Three.js · GitHub") is positioned at the bottom-right of the viewport. On mobile, the Bottom Dock (Time & View Controls) expands vertically and spans most of the width, causing a direct collision with the footer text. The text renders on top of or mixed with the semi-transparent dock, creating a messy visual.
*   **Recommendation:** Hide the footer on mobile viewports or position it below the dock (if scrolling allows), or move it to the "Help" modal to declutter the main view.

### 2. Label Overlap (All Viewports)
**Severity: 🟡 MED**
The CSS2D labels for the inner solar system (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) are clustered tightly. On mobile and tablet, this results in a "blob" of white text where individual labels are indistinguishable.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement a dynamic Label Manager that hides labels based on camera distance or screen-space separation.

### 3. Bottom Dock Vertical Real Estate (Mobile/Tablet)
**Severity: 🟡 MED**
On narrower screens (`audit_tablet.png` and `audit_mobile.png`), the control dock breaks into two rows. While functional, it consumes a large portion of the lower screen, crowding the 3D view.
*   **Recommendation:** Investigate a "Compact Mode" or collapsible dock for mobile devices.

### 4. Previous Findings (Status Check)
*   **Stray Pixel (Bottom Right):** Not clearly visible in new screenshots. likely resolved or obscured by the footer issue.
*   **Icon Consistency:** Buttons now uniformly use icons, looking consistent.
