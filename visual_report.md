## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### 1. 🔴 HIGH: Speed Control Label Overlap (Mobile)
**Location:** `mobile_audit.png` - Settings Panel  
**Perspective:** ZOOM IN (Fine Details)

**Observation:**
In the Mobile view (375px), the speed control area is too narrow. The text "Speed" and the value "1.0x" overlap with the slider control or each other, rendering them difficult to read.

**Impact:**
User cannot clearly see the current speed setting or label.

### 2. 🟡 MED: Cramped Control Dock (Mobile)
**Location:** `mobile_audit.png` - Bottom Dock  
**Perspective:** MACRO (Layout)

**Observation:**
The circular control buttons at the bottom of the screen have insufficient margin between them on mobile. They appear almost touching, which increases the likelihood of accidental clicks (fat-finger error).

**Impact:**
Degraded usability and aesthetics on mobile devices.

### 3. 🟢 LOW: WebGL Console Warnings
**Location:** Console  
**Perspective:** CODE (Invisible but relevant)

**Observation:**
Multiple `WebGL: INVALID_OPERATION: useProgram: program not valid` warnings observed during simulation start. While not immediately visible in the render, this suggests underlying shader or state issues.

## ✅ Verified Improvements (From Previous Audit)
- [x] **Header Alignment:** Verified on Desktop. Title is centered.
- [x] **Planet Label Overlap:** Verified on Mobile (Static location). Labels appear distinct for Earth/Venus in current position, though dynamic overlap risk remains.
- [x] **Tablet Spacing:** Verified on Tablet. Dock spacing looks consistent.
