# 👁️ Visual Inspection Report

| Screenshot | Viewport | Severity | Issue Type | Description |
|------------|----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| `Desktop_zoom_out_far.png` | Desktop | 🔴 HIGH | Disappearance | Entire solar system disappears at large distances (>50,000 units) due to camera far plane clipping. |
| `Mobile_initial.png` | Mobile | 🟡 MED | Layout | "Interactive Solar System" title wraps excessively. "Command Palette" button text overlaps/wraps awkwardly. |
| `Mobile_initial.png` | Mobile | 🟡 MED | Overflow | "Pause Play" and "Reset View" labels in the help modal wrap or are cramped. |
| `Tablet_initial.png` | Tablet | 🟢 LOW | Spacing | Modal content is slightly cramped but readable. |
| `Desktop_zoom_in_close.png` | Desktop | 🟢 LOW | Clipping | Zooming inside the Sun (radius < 2.5) results in a solid color view (internal sprite visibility) or clipping. |

## Details

### 1. Disappearing Solar System (Far Zoom)
**Severity: 🔴 HIGH**
At a camera distance of 50,000 units (`Desktop_zoom_out_far.png`), the entire scene renders as black. This confirms a bug where the camera's `far` clipping plane (currently set to 1000 in `main.js`) is insufficient for deep space exploration, causing objects to be culled prematurely.

### 2. Welcome Modal Layout (Mobile)
**Severity: 🟡 MED**
In `Mobile_initial.png` (375px width):
- The title "Interactive Solar System" breaks onto three lines, consuming significant vertical space.
- The Key/Action grid is squeezed.
- **Button Text Overflow:** The "Command Palette" label inside the `Cmd+K` row appears broken or misaligned.
- **Visual Clutter:** The modal backdrop allows the bottom dock to bleed through, creating contrast issues.

### 3. Zoom/Clipping Artifacts
**Severity: 🟢 LOW**
When zooming extremely close to celestial bodies (e.g., the Sun at < 2.5 units), the camera clips inside the mesh geometry. While this is expected 3D behavior, it manifests as a "disappearing" object (if the interior is unlit/black) or a solid field of color (if sprites are present, as seen in `Desktop_zoom_in_close.png`).
