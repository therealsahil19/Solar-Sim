## 2025-05-18 - [Texture Toggle Failure on Instanced Meshes]
**Symptom:** When toggling texture mode (HD/LD) using the 'T' key, only the Sun and primary non-instanced planets updated. Moons and other instanced bodies remained stuck in their initial textured state.
**Root Cause:** The `toggleTextures` function in `main.js` only iterated through the `interactionTargets` list and expected material references (`texturedMaterial`, `solidMaterial`) to be present on the `mesh.userData`. For `InstancedMesh` objects (managed by `InstanceRegistry`), the `userData` containing these material references resides on the instance *pivots* (the `THREE.Group` wrappers), not on the `InstancedMesh` itself. Additionally, `InstancedMesh` requires updating its shared material directly, which was not being handled.
**Fix Pattern:** Modified `toggleTextures` in `src/main.js` to explicitly iterate through `instanceRegistry.groups`. For each group, it retrieves the material variants from the first instance's `userData` and applies the correct material to the `group.mesh`.
